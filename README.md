# European-Superstore-Sales-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing European sales data using data visualization techniques. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle in Excel format. The project involved data preprocessing to ensure data integrity followed by creating an intuitive and minimalist House Sales Dashboard using Tableau.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about European sales, including sales by month, product, country, sales amount, and profit.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Checked for missing values and data inconsistencies.
   - Ensured data quality by handling null values and other types of errors.

2. **Data Visualization with Tableau**:
   - Created an elegant European Sales Dashboard with a minimalist approach.
   - The dashboard includes the following visualizations:

   - **Sales Trend by Month**: Displayed the trend of sales over time using a line graph with markers.
   - **Sales by Product Visualization**: Illustrated sales by product and added an average marker line to distinguish products below and above average.
   - **Sales by Country Map Visualization**: Visualized sales by country on a map for easy geographical analysis.

3. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
   - Two KPIs were added to provide a quick overview of sales and profit.
   - These KPIs dynamically change based on the selected visualizations.
